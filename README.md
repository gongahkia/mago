## Reference

The name `Mago` is in reference to [Mago](https://yokwe-yokai-of-korea.fandom.com/de/wiki/Mago) (마고), the primordial goddess of creation within the [Korean Mythos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_mythology) who later became the island of [Jeju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Island). She is also known by other names, such as [Magu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magu_(deity)) (麻姑) in Chinese and Mako (マコ) in Japanese.
